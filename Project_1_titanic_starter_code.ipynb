    "The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will exercise your skills with loading data, python data structures, and Pandas to identify charactaristics of Titanic survivors!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "#### Your goals should be to:\n",
    "* Practice python programming including loops, conditionals, types, functions, and data structures\n",
    "* Start thinking critically about manipulating, organizing, and interpreting data\n",
    "* Troubleshoot errors\n",

    "#### Submission:\n",
    "* You should be working on a **fork** of the GA project one repository. \n",
    "* Use **git** to manage versions of your project. Make sure to `add`, `commit`, and `push` your changes to **your fork** of the github \n",
    "* Submit a link to your project repository in the submission form by **Friday, 9/29 11:59 PM**. You will then receive the solutions.\n",
    "* Create a copy of your original notebook (file > make a copy in jupyter notebook)\n",
    "* In the copy, use the solutions to correct your work. Make sure to take note of your successes and struggles. Did you learn anything new from correcting your work?\n",
    "* Submit the corrected version by **Sunday, 10/1 11:59 PM** to receive instructor feedback on your work. ***Projects submitted after this deadline will not receive instructor feedback.***"

    "* Be explicit with your naming. You may forget what `this_list` is, but you will have an idea of what `passenger_fare_list` is. Variable naming will help you in the long run!\n",
    "* Don't forget about tab autocomplete!\n",
    "* Use markdown cells to document your planning, thoughts, and results. \n",
