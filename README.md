# Project 1: Titanic

## Predicting Titanic Survival

This was my first project for the Data Science Immersive prorgram at General Assembly.

Working with the Titanic survivors dataset, the goals of this project were to:
- Practice python programming including loops, conditionals, types, functions, data structures, pandas and visualization,
- Start thinking critically about manipulating, organizing, and interpreting data,
- Use summary statistics to analyze the probability of who survived the Titanic sinking.
